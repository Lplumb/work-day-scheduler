# work-day-scheduler

The work day schedule project is a website that allows you to enter in text into boxes that represents different times

The site keeps track of the time using a moment script and it will change the color of the time blocks depending on what the current time is

You are able to click into any of the time blocks and enter whatever and save it into the users local storage by clicking the blue save button besides it, the time blocks will also change colors 
depending on the hour, with hours that have already happened being grey, with the current time being red, and the future hours being green.

Also at the top of the web page we can also just view the current date and year.
